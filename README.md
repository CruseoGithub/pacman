 # About the Game

 This game is inspired by the original arcade pac-man game.
 The protagonist is Pac-Man a yellow ball with a mouth. Pac-Man finds himself in a maze which he can not escape from.
 Only eating all the dots which are scattered around the map will get pac-man to the next level. 
 But beware! There are enemy ghosts on the map too and they are deadly! At first they might not seem to smart but they will get more and more intelligent.
 Keep in mind, they eventually will try to cut of every escape route.
 Don't be too freighted though, there are some special items to collect which will give pac-man some pretty cool buffs:
 - Hunter item: pac-man gets into rage mode! He becomes very fast and can kill ghost for a period of time.
 - Life item: Pac-Man gets an extra Life (1up)
 - Slow item: Ghost are slower for a short time
 - Time item: The clock is always ticking! ...but now Pac-Man has 10 more seconds.
 
 The game will iterate through a bunch of maps and increase the difficulty each time. 
 This means, over time there will be more ghosts which get smarter. 
 Also the overall speed of every actor will increase. 
 
 The first map features a classic pac-man design and layout. All other maps keep the same layout but have some very unique graphics. 
 We wanted to have our on take on the game, so we did put a lot of effort into designing these maps. Each map has its own look and feel.
 The custom SFX and music gives the game a personal touch too. ("ALARM!!!!")
